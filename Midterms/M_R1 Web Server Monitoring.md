# SYSADM1 -- Web Server Monitoring

1.  How do you monitor web server statistics?

-   Tracking different metrics is part of monitoring web server
    statistics in order to evaluate server performance and detect
    possible problems. Web servers such as Apache include built-in
    features that can be used to accomplish this. It is also possible to
    develop  applications to gather and examine particular metrics. CPU,
    memory, network traffic, request rate, response time, and error rate
    are important signs to keep an eye on.

2.  What are the key metrics that you need to monitor in a web server?

-   The key metrics that you need to monitor in a web server are the
    date, time, CPU usage, Memory usage, request rate, response time,
    error rate and the error type.

3.  Analyze the provided web server statistics to determine what is
    being asked for below.

height="1.9631944444444445in"}

A.  Average response time: 738.89 ms

B.  Request per second: 1 request per second

C.  Memory usage: 200 MB

D.  Error rate: 22.2%

E.  Common error types: 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error

<!-- -->
```
4.  What are the possible issues in the web server statistics above?

-   Some possible issues in the web server statistics are high error
    rate because of the occurrence of the 500 Internal Server Error and
    404 Not Found which means that request was not found. Also, the high
    memory usage which indicates that if the server reaches its limit
    then it could lead to crashes or degradation of performance.

  Monitoring       10       Demonstrates understanding of various methods for
  methods                   monitoring web server statistics (e.g., using tools,
                            server logs, performance counters).

  Key Metrics      10       Identifies the correct key metrics to monitor (e.g.,
                            response time, traffic, error rates, resource usage).

  Data Analysis    30       Accurately calculates average response time, requests
                            per second, memory usage, error rate, and identifies
                            common error types.

  Issues           10       Accurately identifies potential issues based on the
